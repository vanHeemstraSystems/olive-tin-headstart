## 100 - Installation

See [README.md](./100/README.md)

## 200 - Configuration

OliveTin is controlled by a ```config.yaml``` file. On startup, it looks for this file in the following locations;

1. The current working directory (./)

2. /config/ - Mostly used for containers

3. /etc/OliveTin/ - this is the recommended directory on Linux for your config.yaml.

The most simple ```config.yaml``` would be something like this;

```
actions:
  - title: "Hello world!"
    shell: echo 'Hello World!'
``` 
containers/olivetin/config.yaml

In the "Actions" section of this documentation you can find lots of examples of how to setup additional actions.
